![A simple pedal position sensor](pedal_sensor.png)  
3D-printed pedal sensor used on a TopKart Blue Eagle in 2016.  It gives a linear ouptput, approx 0.4 to 2.9 V over the pedal stroke.  The magnet is fixed to the pedal and moves past the tip of a Hall chip with analogue output. 
The north pole of the permanent magnet points towards the sensor chip when the pedal is half pressed.  The Hall chip senses magnetic flux through the chip -- in the direction of pedal movement.
The sleeve for the Hall chip is easily clipped on/off to the bracket for easy installation/removal -- without using an electrical connector.
